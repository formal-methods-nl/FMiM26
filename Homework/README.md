# Homework exercises

This folder contains the homework exercises for this course. Most homework exercises
consist of a `.lean` file which contains multiple `sorry`s. Your task is to fill
the `sorry`s with a compiling proof. If you don't manage to complete a proof,
please provide partial progress and explain using comments on what you are stuck.
